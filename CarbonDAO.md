  **Summary:**The on-chain solution for sustainability: encode carbon offsetting into smart contracts.
  **Deployment Status:**
  **Description:**Carbon[[DAO]] works with suppliers to source Verified Carbon Units (VCUs) for [[token]]sation and currently exploring supporting projects on the Verra [[Registry]]. Verra is the global leader in developing and mananging standards to reach sustainable development goals. Carbon[[DAO]] explores VCUs held in an approved off-chain custodian's active Verra [[registry]] account in exchange for a corresponding Semi-Fungible Security [[token]] (SFST0. An SFST minted provides the [[token]] with a unique VCU number. SFTs can be deposited in Carbon Pools in exchange for the Fungible Carbon [[Token]]s corresponding to that Pool. The distribution of Carbon Pools' SFST properties controls the portfolio of carbon projects.
