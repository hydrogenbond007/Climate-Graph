**Deployment Status:**
**Description:**A decentralized community of active citizens that take initiatives to transition to a more sustainable world. Some of us organize marches for the climate, others start community gardens, plant trees, reclaim old airports, the public space, make movies, make art. Some create mutual aid funds to help their community after a natural disaster, others build software or develop new protocols. We are all hummingbirds doing our part and we are coming together as a DAO to support each other.
