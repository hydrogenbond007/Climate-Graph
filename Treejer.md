  **Summary:**Treejer functions as a link between those who fund trees and those who plant them even in the most remote places on our planet. It records credit ownership and enables secure payment between different parties using smart-contracts.
  **Deployment Status:**Yes
  **Description:**Treejer is an open protocol connecting funders to rural planters worldwide. The project is experimenting with cutting-edge concepts such as decentralized finance (DeFi), non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and smart contracts to unlock new opportunities in climate finance and rural development.  Treejer Protocol acts as a transparent bridge. Individuals and organizations are encouraged to fund trees with it and local communities are paid to plant and maintain them as they grow. The protocol uses blockchain-based smart contracts to receive funding for trees and redistribute it to planters and other stakeholders in a transparent way. A Local Development Fund distributes recurring micro-loans to participating communities for other sustainable development activities such as children education and local entrepreneurship. The Tree Rescue Fund acts as an insurance to plant new trees when wildfires or other natural disasters hit the sites. The Tree Research Fund sponsors scientific researches required for developing Treejer, such as impact analyses, economic modelling and finding allometric equations of tree species to estimate their absorbed carbon.
