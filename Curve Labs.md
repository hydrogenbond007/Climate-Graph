  **Description:**Curve Labs are architects that source and combine open-source blockchain primitives to create novel organizations. They aim to democratize wealth generation and distribution using [[token]] engineering to facilitate a liquid and sustainable long-tail of emerging ecosystems. Some of their projects include PrimeDAO (a blockchain-native organization that is researching and building next-generation coordination tools for decentralized finance), [[Celo]] Climate Collective (a key regenerative finance initiative launched by the [[Celo]] community to leverage Web3 in fighting climate change), and Toucan Protocol (an org that uses mechanism design to transform the existing carbon sequestration supply chain).
