  **Description:**Creol uses IoT that monitors your building system using blockchain to create a completely verified system.
  With our mobile dApp, users can manage their personal comfort levels, energy usage, carbon footprint and responses to help you better your buildings. By enabling verified [[data]] in our system, tenants who want a green building no longer have to base decisions on reputation and trust. We can provide a truly transparent eco-system for managing and offsetting carbon, so when you say your building is green, now you can prove it. Buildings with a Creol system installed create an environmental benefit by supporting projects that remove more carbon dioxide from the atmosphere than the buildings produce, making them Carbon positive.
