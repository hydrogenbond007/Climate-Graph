  **Summary:**Nature-based carbon removal company, on a mission to unlock nature's value. We are revolutionizing the forest carbon industry via the use of remote sensing technology and an end-to-end business model. We connect rural landowners to the global carbon offseet market, shrinking the carbon supply chain and providing a strong financial incentive for responsible woodland creation.
  **Deployment Status:**
  **Description:**Project Development — We develop, package, annd sell carbon removal credits on behalf of landowners undertaking nature-based projects, providing them with a sustianable income stream and meeting companies' growing demand for high-quality offsets. Measurement and Monitoring — We use high-resolution remote sensing [[data]] to massively improve the accuracy of carbon accounting within carbon removal projects. We repeat this analysis on an ongoing basis to maintain the accuracy and trust for buyers so they can monitor their impact over time. Carbon Credit Sales — We only bring high-quality rigorously monitored carbon removal credits to the market which facilitate wider ecosystem and biodiversity benefits alongside climate benefits. Natural Capital Baselining — Natural Capital baselining is a critical starting point for any carbon project. Baselining carbon stock estimations allow you to make credible claims about additional activites and provide comprehensive future-proofing against regulations that are currently undermined.
