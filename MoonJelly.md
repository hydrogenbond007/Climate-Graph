  **Subtype** [[DAO]] 
  **Tags:** [[Ocean]] 
  **Summary:**Moonjelly is utilizing web3 technology to reinvent how we
  fund, explore and profit from restoring the [[ocean]]
  **Deployment Status:**
  **Description:**Moonjelly focuses on using web3 tools to fight climate change through [[Ocean]]. Their solutions are: to distribute grant-funding for impact projects in a more transparent and effective way; make more grants accessible to projects and places that donâ€™t have access to more remote, ecologically rich locations; use the power of DAOS (educating more people, mostly scientists, about how to DAO and use it for impact); sell impact-backed NFTs to make [[ocean]] conservation profitable and sustainable; connect web3 savvy donors with [[ocean]] conservation.
