  **Subtype** [[Product]]
  **Tags:** Carbon | MRV | Supply
  **Summary:**Legitimately manage green risks by validating greenhouse gas claims with granular sensor [[data]] and tokenizing it for trade
  **Deployment Status:**
  **Description:**At the University of California at Berkeley, our Chief Scientist Professor Emeritus Ronald Cohen has built over the last decade a working prototype hardware [[network]] of 70 low cost sensors monitoring municipalities in California and the [[data]] science techniques to trace the sources of CO2 emissions: Berkeley Environmental Air-quality & CO2 [[Network]]. Secured Carbon is executing on the vision of Prof. Cohen and his fellow prominent climate scientists to deploy low cost [[network]]s in all 300 U.S. cities with populations greater than 100,000.
