- # Climate Collective
  **Subtype** [[Network]]
  **Tags:** Funding | Education
  **Summary:**Inspired by Charles Eisenstein's Sacred Economics, the collective is proposing that over the next 4 years, up to 40% of the [[Celo]] Reserve (which backs the [[Celo]] Dollar and [[Celo]] Euro stablecoins) transition to tokenized rainforest and other carbon sequestering assets to support natural capital backed currencies on the [[Celo]] platform. Climate Collective also aims to leverage [[Celo]]’s mobile-first infrastructure to improve the transparency and efficiency in disbursement of nature-based finances. 
  **Deployment Status:**Yes
  **Description:**The Climate Collective is an expanding coalition of companies collaboratively building at the intersection of web3 and climate action. Through grant funding, member partnerships, and community education, we support a range of impactful products and interoperable protocols that progress the Regenerative Finance (“ReFi”) ecosystem. Our mission is to accelerate regenerative applications using [[Celo]]’s carbon-negative blockchain and mobile-first infrastructure, with the overarching goal of backing [[Celo]] stablecoins by tokenized natural assets using the [[Celo]] Reserve.
