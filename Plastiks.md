  **Description:**Plastiks is a [[marketplace]] enabling companies to trade Plastic Recovery Guarantees. Worldwide plastic recovery projects are using our platform to upload their plastic recovery [[data]]. Thanks to [[NFT]] technology we can prove verifiable impact stories of how and where plastic has been recovered. How does it work: Plastic waste is recovered from the environment. The plastic collectors generate an invoice with a tax ID number, location, quantity, and type of plastic recovered. The invoice is verified by Plastiks to certify the act of recovery. The invoice is digitalized as a recovery guarantee. Companies can buy the recovery guarantees, and merge them with their own [[NFT]] creations, to bring utility and value to their customers while doing good for the environment. Strengthen your brand reputation by supporting plastic recovery projects around the world and invite your customers to do the same.
