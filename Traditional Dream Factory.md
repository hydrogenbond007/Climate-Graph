**Description:**TDFâ€™s goal is to imagine how people live together, to put into practice years of research in creating abundant food systems that work with nature, to retain water in soils and avoid erosion and droughts, and to create human living systems that leave a positive trace on its environment. The idea is to prove we can optimize resources while nurturing a creative and thriving community and at the same time leave a positive trace on the environment, by building a big coliving space where people can live, create, and regenerate together.
