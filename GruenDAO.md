  **Summary:**GrüenDAO develops financial markets for the carbon economy
  **Deployment Status:**
  **Description:**GrüenDAO fights climate change by investing in and monetizing carbon credits (through carbon offset [[tokenization]]), climate change technologies, and applications of climate change solutions. The collective operates a decentralized financial protocol for members to define, shape, and develop market-driven carbon assets. GrüenDAO ecosystem can significantly improve, outperform, and replace traditional financial markets in the carbon economy. We strive to set the new standards for the newly emerging carbon economic system and, at the crucial early stage, capture the underlying value chain of the critical asset class, both for the economic benefits and positive impact to address the existential climate threats.
