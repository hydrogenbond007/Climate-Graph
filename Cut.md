  **Summary:**Our ambitious blockchain project allows you to reduce your carbon footprint transparently on-chain, in any amount, at any time.
  **Deployment Status:**
  **Description:**Carbon Utility [[Token]] (CUT) is a utility [[token]] that allows you to reduce your carbon footprint transparently on-chain, in any amount, at any time. CUT is backed by certified carbon offsets generated from the removal and destruction of carbon by landfill gas and biomass projects. They work with independent power producers to continually source more offsets for the pool as [[token]]s are retired from supply. Whenever minting takes place each [[token]] grows to represent an increased volume of carbon it can: hold, trade or retire from circulation forever.
