  **Subtype** Protocol
  **Tags:** Carbon | [[Tokenization]]
  **Summary:**Connecting project developers, climate assets, [[data]] and finance in a trustworthy, transparent climate ecosystem.
  **Deployment Status:**Beta
  **Description:**Changeblock addresses the structural changes necessary to support global decarbonization by introducing a transparent market infrastructure that, at its core, enables access, trust, [[liquidity]], marketability, assurance of contract completion, and connectivity across regional climate markets to global capital and private sector institutions. Changeblock homogenizes diverse climate assets to create a [[marketplace]] that promotes high-quality impact investment and better environmental, social, and governance outcomes for all participants. To achieve this, Changeblock has developed two transparent and accessible classes of instruments, known as Climate Backed Tonnes (CBTs) and Changeblocks (CBLKs), and a utility asset, called CHNG.
