- # DrawDAO
  **Subtype** DAO
  **Tags:** Carbon | Supply
  **Summary:**DrawDAO is a community of carbon drawdown project operators, climate activists, scientists, and artists fighting climate change via the open-sourcing of carbon dioxide removal & storage (CDRS) methodologies and the pledging of funds to new and emerging CDRS projects.
  **Deployment Status:**No
  **Description:**We're on a mission to drive awareness to, catalyze, and fund the creation of hundreds of new carbon drawdown projects. We plan to do this by launching 12 unique [[NFT]] collections over 12 months for each project we back -- with artwork commissioned by artists from frontline communities most affected by climate change. Projects will be betted by an application process that will include review by a panel of climate change scientists and legal experts. Draw DAO plans to release a platform that enables CDRS project creators to list their project for crowdfunding from retail investors, corporates, philanthropists, etc. And eventually announce the DRWDAO ERC20 [[token]] to provide [[liquidity]] to other projects.
