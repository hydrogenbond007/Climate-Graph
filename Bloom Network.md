- # Bloom [[Network]]
  **Subtype** Ground
  **Tags:** 
  **Summary:**Climate action [[network]] with on-the-ground DAOs and an online social [[network]]. We help more people find and participate in regenerative actions.
  **Deployment Status:**
  **Description:**There are 16 local Blooms in 7 countries, and over 50 projects have been incubated and started through the [[network]]. We estimate there are 30,000 people involved on the ground, and growing quickly. Bloom participants support each other across different towns and countries by sharing knowledge and building upon each otherâ€™s breakthroughs. If you are concerned about big social challenges like climate change and social inequality, through Bloom(ing) you will find ways to do something about it that is meaningful to you, in community with other people. If you are a maker or leader working on regenerative initiatives, Bloom is a place you can find peer support for developing your projects and distributing your offerings.
