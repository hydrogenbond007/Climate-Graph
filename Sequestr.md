  **Summary:**Sequestr is a scaling supply of carbon removal through better data, pricing & efficient capital throughout the entire project lifecycle. 
  **Deployment Status:**
  **Description:**Sequestr partners with  farmers and project developers working on high quality carbon projects to provide exclusive access across maturity stage. These carbon offsets are verified by an independent third party, approved by Sequestr experts and listed on the  [[marketplace]]. Projects are listed with important buyer criteria such as regional data, methodology, price per ton and comps. These future certified carbon offsets are sold via an auction model using historical and predictive pricing data, demand signals and  proprietary risk modelling to determine the fair market price. Buyers can then engage in the secondary market to resell their carbon offset futures, buy from other resellers, and do a lot more than historically has been possible with existing carbon offset financial infrastructure.
