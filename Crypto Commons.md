  **Description:**Crypto commons are a subset of digital commons emerging in the context of Distributed Ledger Technology. They comprise base layer protocols, applications built on top of them as well as tools and mechanisms used in their design and calibration. In contrast to pre-DLT commons they usually make active use of market mechanisms and economic incentives in order to reward contributions to the common Good.
