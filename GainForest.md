  **Subtype** [[Data]]
  **Tags:** MRV | Geospatial
  **Summary:**GainForestâ„¢ is a decentralised green fund using artificial intelligence to measure and reward sustainable nature stewardship.
  **Deployment Status:**Yes
  **Description:**GainForest is an open platform that empowers sustainable conservation efforts by unifying 1) accessible and automated monitoring, 2) auditable and decentralized payments and 3) stakeholder engagement and user-focused [[token]] incentives into one system. The GainForest platform replaces a trusted third party with a self-enforcing smart contract thus providing transparent and frictionless transactions. A programmable smart contract also creates automated trust through [[data]]-driven impact verification and novel incentives for donors to become investors through [[token]] economics. Real-world project areas are represented virtually through an NFTree, allowing conservation projects to continuously raise funds for sustainable stewardship.
