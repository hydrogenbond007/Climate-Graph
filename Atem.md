  **Summary:**Atem [[Network]] is a decentralized social infrastructure of web3 where users can chat, trade and govern in a p2p secured group space.
  **Deployment Status:**Yes
  **Description:**On ATEM’s platform, users will be able to chat about a cryptocurrency or an [[NFT]] and be able to execute a trade there and then. This can be performed because all [[data]] is on-chain and able to be accessed via Web3 APIs and through end-to-end encryption. On ATEM, users not only can chat to each other like in traditional chatrooms, but send tokens and [[NFT]]s as well. ATEM’s one-stop solution allows users to trade tokens and [[NFT]]s seamlessly in one place without the need to leave the chat room and log onto another exchange platform to perform the transaction. Trade prices are offered by a tier-1 swap on each chain. All transactions are done through APIs and are executed by smart contracts, offering a smooth user experience.
