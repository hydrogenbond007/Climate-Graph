  **Subtype** DAO
  **Tags:** [[Ocean]]
  **Summary:**Aquari is a community governed cryptocurrency with the goal to restore all polluted bodies of water on Earth.
  **Deployment Status:**Yes
  **Description:**Aquari was formed in the wake of a scam in early 2021 where investors had their money stolen from the creators of a meme cryptocurrency. Distraught by the hit to their pockets fueled by meme mania, this community pondered the idea of creating their own cryptocurrency â€“ one that had a legitimate utility and one in which it's developers would value transparency as their number one virtue. There needed to be a solid utility behind the economy of the [[token]] so that it's growth would move in tandem with market enthusiasm. As an avid lover of animals and nature, the community set out to develop a [[token]] that not only could help save the planet but also garner constant support from enthusiasts and newcomers alike.
