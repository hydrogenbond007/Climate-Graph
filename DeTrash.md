  **Subtype** DAO
  **Tags:** Plastic | Waste Management
  **Summary:**A RECY [[Token]] represents a kg of waste that had a sustainable destination. RECY [[TOKEN]] sales supports waste recycling and collecting projects.
  **Deployment Status:**Yes
  **Description:**Detrash believes that one of the most effective solutions for diminishing recyclable
  waste production while boosting the recycling production chain necessarily goes
  through giving the efficient market incentive through crypto assets for who generates
  recyclable waste based on both delivery of recyclables to recycling partners, and non
  biodegradable supply chain substitution.
