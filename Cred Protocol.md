  **Summary:**Cred is a decentralized credit score. A financial pirmitive that enables web3 smart contracts to make better risk-based decisions. 
  **Deployment Status:**
  **Description:**Created for DeFi lending protocols and DAOs who can use Cred's scores to offer capital-efficient loans and qualify membership. Cred scores risk by correlating propensity for loan liquidation with on-chain wallet history. We're helping regular people use their good reputation to amplify access to financial resources, whether expanding a business or buying a house. DeFi loans are commonly overcollatearlized up to 800%, making them unusable by regular people. By quantifying borrowing risks we're enabling access to loans that make a difference.
