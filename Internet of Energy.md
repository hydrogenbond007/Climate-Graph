  **Subtype** Protocol
  **Tags:** Energy
  **Summary:**The Internet of Energy [[Network]] (IOEN) is an interconnected system of virtual microgrids that facilitates transactions within & between local energy ecosystems on Holochain.
  **Deployment Status:**Yes
  **Description:**Using blockchain and Holochain technology, IOEN enables homes anywhere to function together as an intelligent, cooperative electricity system. By connecting homes in this way, they become a local, virtual energy microgrid. Any energy device, whether generation devices like solar panel systems, storage devices like batteries, or consumption devices like household appliances can be connected within the minigrid [[network]]. Together, they coordinate energy effectively, creating a secure, reliable, and scalable minigrid that unlocks the opportunity for more renewable energy within the local [[network]]. Clean energy microgrids are the future of energy everywhere. IOENâ€™s mission is to create and deliver digital infrastructure through blockchain and Holochain technologies that accelerates this transition for everyone.
