  **Summary:**Farm offers no-interest financing solutions to land [[steward]]s who are seeking to expand their land ownership and/or operations, but need cash to do so.
  **Deployment Status:**
  **Description:**Farm provides up-front capital in exchange for a revenue share and/or portion of land ownership for an agreed period of time. The [[steward]] can use this cash however they best see fit and can buy out Farm's shares at any time. Through FarmFi the applicant uploads their financial documents and business proposal. After a time, the FarmFi team reviews the documents and gives them an answer of whether they will be financed or not, if so, the FarmFi money goes directly to the applicantâ€™s bank account. People can also apply to invest in land, instead of receiving an investment.
