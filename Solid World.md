  **Subtype** [[Product]]
  **Tags:** Vertical | Carbon | Supply
  **Summary:**Solid World [[DAO]] mission is to build core infrastructure to make forward carbon markets as liquid as possible - unlocking the value of forward deals for carbon projects and the institutions that buy them. 
  **Deployment Status:**
  **Description:**The infrastructure that Solid World [[DAO]] is building makes historically illiquid assets liquid, by leveraging the power of decentralized finance. This opens the door for new kinds of previously unimaginable structures to be created around it. Loan facilities, self-repaying loans denominated in carbon, [[liquidity]]-provision-based carbon accumulation, and on-chain delivery de-risking among many others. Solid World [[DAO]] sees the power in having a public spot price for forward assets. Solid World [[DAO]] intends, after the successful launch of the core infrastructure, to develop a facility for specific forward agreements to be collateralized against the relevant commodity pool - unlocking capital efficiency for forward carbon trading.
