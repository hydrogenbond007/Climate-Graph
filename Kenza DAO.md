  **Description:**Kenza is a DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) with the mission to accelerate early climate action by homes, small businesses, and communities. The Kenza [[network]]  is powered by a blockchain with a native protocol [[token]] incentivizing a two-sided carbon credit [[marketplace]]. We credentialise emissions performance and provide the means for private corporations and public institutions to purchase carbon offsets from environmentally-responsible citizens, which as a result, will fuel green economies.
