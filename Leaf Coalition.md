- # Leaf Coalition
  **Subtype** [[Network]]
  **Tags:** Carbon | Demand
  **Summary:**The Lowering Emissions by Accelerating Forest finance (LEAF) Coalition's goal is to halt deforestation by financing large scape tropical forest protection. In 2021, the Coalition mobilized $1bn in financing, kicking off the largest-ever public-private effort to protect tropical forests. 
  **Deployment Status:**
  **Description:**It is a priority for the LEAF Coalition that companies make deep cuts in their own value chain emissions. Purchase of credits through LEAF comes in addition to, and not as a substitute for, internal abatement in line with Paris. To join LEAF, companies must publicly commit to science-based targets (SBTi) or equivalent quantified and independently verified decarbonization targets, consistent with limiting warming in line with the long-term temperature goal of the Paris Agreement, with no or limited overshoot. Companies must have the targets in place before taking title to LEAF emissions reductions, no later than 2023.
