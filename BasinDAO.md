  **Subtype** Ground
  **Tags:** RWAs | Carbon | Supply
  **Summary:**We use land ownership, carbon markets, and an emerging eco-credit class to create absolute returns and climate resilience.
  **Deployment Status:**
  **Description:**We generate industry leading, fully verifiable, net-positive carbon and eco-credits through protocol owned real estate and joint ventures with landowners. We develop EcoCredits by measuring biodiversity condition and net gain at stewardship sites, ensuring highest quality ecosystem carbon capture and long term storage, understanding the social & ecological benefits of optimized water usage & conservation, and capturing  value through drought, fire, and flood risk resilience. The $BASIN [[token]] bundles protocol owned real estate and ecocredit supply for real asset-backed exposure to natural capital on the blockchain. basinDAO is global DAO reducing/removing carbon, restoring/protecting nature and improving human health/wealth.
  
  Also known as the "project developer" DAO, basin works at the real property level building and executing climate, nature and carbon projects with an emphasis on "core benefits" such as biodiversity, ecosystem services and climate resilience.
