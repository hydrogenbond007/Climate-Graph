  **Subtype** Protocol
  **Tags:** Carbon | [[Token]]ization
  **Summary:**Building the 1st StableCoin 100% Backed by Nature Assets
  **Deployment Status:**
  **Description:**KUMO enables borrowing a stablecoin* KUSD against [[token]]ized carbon credits with no interest rate. The idea of KUMO is simple yet powerful: Enabling money to recognize regenerative practice in healing our biosphere. Building on top of existing carbon credits bridging protocols, our protocol accepts deposits and allows minting green KUSD stablecoins pegged to USD. The more KUSD is in circulation, the more carbon is taken off-market and more financing is available to carbon projects. Money becomes our ally in fighting climate change. This is what matters. No [[token]] dump, no price volatility - Only standing to value our planet.
