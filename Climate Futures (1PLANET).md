- # Climate Futures (1PLANET)
  **Subtype** Protocol
  **Tags:** Carbon | [[Token]]ization
  **Summary:**1PLANET is an eco-system with many connectivity points for scalability for individual, small-business, and enterprise solutions.
  **Deployment Status:**Yes
  **Description:**1PLANET [[token]]s will power our Hyperledger and unlike non-blockchain solutions, buyers of 1PLANET [[token]] have the options to bank (store in their crypto-wallet), transfer, or use these [[token]]s in the future for offsetting or with partner e-commerce platforms. After each 1PLANET [[token]] is used for offsetting, the [[token]] will be permanently burned, and the corresponding carbon credits from Climate Futures project portfolio will be permanently retired/burned and their serial numbers are written into the blockchain for an immediate audit trail.
