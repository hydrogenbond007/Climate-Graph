  **Deployment Status:**
  **Description:**Alongside farmers, agronomists, and food companies, rePlant is building a new financial system to recognize and scale an agricultural philosophy that provides important ecosystem services for the climate. We create partnerships with regional and multinational food companies to directly access their supply chains. We develop financing options for farmers who are willing and ready to adopt regenerative or organic practices that work for them. We connect farmers to technical assistance, from agronomists, soil conservationists, NGOs, and other technical experts. We deploy capital to accelerate farmer transitions to regenerative and organic agriculture, tying financing terms to soil health via the Soil Fund, an evergreen private debt fund.
