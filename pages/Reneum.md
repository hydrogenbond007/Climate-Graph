- Our product is a marketplace open to all, built on Polygon, with the objective of directing capital to climate solutions, effectively democratising access to fund initiatives that will help meet climate goals given the urgency needed to scale these (and the lack of funding towards them due to corporate lobbies and government agendas).
- As mentioned above, the first climate solution we will direct capital towards is renewable energy. We are aiming to accelerate the energy transition by focusing on sending capital to projects in emerging markets initially (where it is needed most urgently), through our version of digital Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs) in the form of our RENW token and Eisbaer NFT which acts as the “verified green’ certificate of having greened your footprint.
