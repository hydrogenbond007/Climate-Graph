  **Summary:**We’re DOVU. We will offset your carbon footprint. Our [[marketplace]] supports carbon capture across the planet. We use impartial soil scientists to calculate the [[data]] and distributed ledger technology, [[Hedera]] Hashgraph, to verify its authenticity.
  **Deployment Status:**Yes
  **Description:**Our vision is to build a trust layer of carbon offset integrity. We’re doing this by unlocking the carbon stored in soil and harnessing the power of decentralised finance to tackle crypto’s carbon footprint. All through a growing global community of farmers, crypto organisations and [[token]] holders.
