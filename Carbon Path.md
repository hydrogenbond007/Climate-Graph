  **Summary:**Our mission is to create scalable, verifiable, tradable carbon offsets. These offsets incentivize climate positive actions, like the early and responsible retirement of hydrocarbon assets like oil and gas wells. 
  **Deployment Status:**
  **Description:**While many corporationns are trying to find credible offsts, these weels are causing trouble for the environment down the line. CarbonPath Group is developing a new carbon offset credit, one with rigorous verification standards and streamlined trading to reward plugging and abandoning these oil and gas wells before they become orphaned. Creates credits for coal mine retirement, industrial carbon capture, renewable energy installation, CO2 sequestration projects, decarbonizing [[product]]ion of chemical and matrials, capturing meethane leaks across industrial assets, and converting vehicle fleets from diesel to electric or renewable hydrogen.
