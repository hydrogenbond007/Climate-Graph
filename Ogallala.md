  **Subtype** [[Product]]
  **Tags:** Stewardship | Watershed
  **Summary:**To utilize web3 technologies to design, develop, and implement sustainable water utilization and farming practices that optimize the value and [[product]]ivity of America’s breadbasket.
  **Deployment Status:**
  **Description:**Our aim is to destroy the very real and imminent threat of food and water scarcity in America caused by the desertification of fertile land, water depletion, and contamination. We educate farmers on sustainable techniques and incentivize them to ensure these practices are implemented. We fund our projects using smart contract-enabled markets and cryptocurrencies. We also seek funding through governmental, public, and private grants. These nontraditional sources coupled with sustainable environmental efforts can be financially beneficial and greatly increase the land’s value.
