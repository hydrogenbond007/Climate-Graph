  **Subtype** [[Product]]
  **Tags:** Carbon
  **Summary:**Wren is for anyone who wants to tackle the climate crisis but isn’t sure where to start. It’s an approachable on-ramp to action: helping people to understand, reduce and offset their carbon footprint.
  **Deployment Status:**No
  **Description:**The Wren Climate Portfolio offsets carbon through a curated selection of effective climate projects. A portion of funds is sent to policy groups, to extend Wren's impact beyond carbon offsets. The Portfolio's allocation is periodically updated to maximize impact. Wren members fund four types of climate solutions: 1) Technology; carbon removal technologies like biochar (in California) and mineral weathering (in Scotland) turn atmospheric CO2 into solid rock. 2) Tree Planting; Wren members help plant millions of native species every year. 3) Policy; Wren members support leading policy groups that push for changes to different systems that influence our planet’s climate (economy, agriculture, infrastructure, power grid). 4) Conservation; Wren helps to protect natural ecosystems like old-growth forests.
