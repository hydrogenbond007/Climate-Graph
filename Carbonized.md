  **Summary:**
  **Deployment Status:**
  **Description:**Carbonized [[NFT]]s are [[NFT]]s that consume carbon that has been captured from the atmosphere and bridged onto the blockchain. The purpose of carbonized [[NFT]]s is to remove tokenized carbon offsets from circulation, forcing corporations and organizations to innovate rather than buy their way towards satisfying carbon emissions regulations. You can think of a carbonized [[NFT]] as an on-chain carbon sink that doesn't just make blockchain transactions carbon neutral but carbon negative.
