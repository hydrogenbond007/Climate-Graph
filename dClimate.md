  **Subtype** [[Data]]
  **Tags:** MRV
  **Summary:**A transparent, decentralized [[marketplace]] that allows participants to buy and share [[data]] and contribute to an open ecosystem of [[data]]-driven climate resilience applications.
  **Deployment Status:**Yes
  **Description:**dClimate is architected with four key layers that together provide a decentralized infrastructure for sourcing, delivering, storing, and incentivizing the use of high-quality climate [[data]]: Governance, Oracle, Blockchain and [[Data]] Storage, and [[Marketplace]]. dClimate offers protocol-level transparency coupled with a feature-rich and intuitive UI.Through a simple and easy rating system, [[data]] consumers will be able to quickly judge which [[data]] publishers offer the most value for a particular need. Clients will also be able to set up payments with ease using digital stablecoin rather than any volatile [[token]] payment method. The validator nodes on the [[network]] will offer quality control that is not available when shopping for [[data]] or forecasts in the current system. Finally, a community of other users will be available to share information and lessons with.
